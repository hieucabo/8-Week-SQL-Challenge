### If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

````sql
SELECT *
INTO temp_pizza_names
FROM pizza_names;
INSERT INTO temp_pizza_names
    VALUES(3,'Supreme');
SELECT * FROM temp_pizza_names
````

| pizza_id | pizza_name |
|----------|------------|
| 1        | Meatlovers |
| 2        | Vegetarian |
| 3        | Supreme    |

````sql
SELECT *
INTO temp_pizza_recipes
FROM pizza_recipes;
INSERT INTO temp_pizza_recipes
    VALUES(3,'1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12');
SELECT * FROM temp_pizza_recipes
````

| pizza_id | toppings                              |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| 1        | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10               |
