## **Introduction**

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, 
giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data.

## **Problem Statement**

Danny has shared the data design for Foodie-Fi and also short descriptions on each of the database tables - our case study focuses on only 2 tables but there will be a challenge to create a new table for the Foodie-Fi team.

### C. Challenge Payment Question

View my solution [here](https://github.com/hieucabo/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%233%20-%20Foodie-Fi/C.%20Challenge%20Payment%20Question.md).

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
